        *NOTE* All programs rely on specially curated GTF or ind files, which are not
        packaged with this software due to their size. Please go to

        for instructions to download the curated GTF files.
        
        TElocal takes RNA-seq (and similar data) and annotates reads
        to both genes & transposable elements.

        Recommendations for TElocal input files
        =========================================
        
        TElocal can perform transposable element quantification from alignment results (e.g. BAM files) generated from a variety of programs.
        Given the variety of experimental systems, we could not provide an optimal alignment strategy for every approach. Therefore,
        we recommend that users identify the optimal parameters for their particular genome and alignment program in order to get the best
        results.
        
        When optimizing the alignment parameters, we recommend taking these points into consideration:
        
        *Allowing sufficient number of multi-mappers during alignment*
        
        Most alignment programs provide only 1 alignment per read by default. We recommend reporting multiple alignments per read. We have found 
        that reporting a maximum of 100 alignments per read provides an optimal compromise between the size of the alignment file and recovery 
        of multi-mappers in many genome builds. However, we highly suggest that users optimize this parameter for their particular experiment, 
        as this could significantly improve the quality of transposable element quantification.
        
        *Optimizing alignment parameters for non-reference strains*
        
        It is common that the specific laboratory strains used in an experiment contains genomic variations not present in the reference strain.
        While this can be mitigated through allowing mismatches during alignments, certain lab strains (e.g. Drosophila melanogaster) have
        diverged significantly from the reference genomes. We highly recommend that users should refine their alignment procedures to better
        account for the expected variations between their lab strains and the reference genome, which will accordingly improve their analysis
        with TElocal. Users can also align to a custom genome build specific to their organism, though they would need GTF annotations for
        genes and transposable elements that are compatible with their custom genome in order to utilize TElocal. Please contact us if you
        require advice in generating these annotation files.
        
        *Specific recommendations when using STAR*
        
        `STAR <https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR>`_ utilizes two parameters for optimal identification of multi-mappers `--outFilterMultimapNmax` and `--outAnchorMultimapNmax`. 
        The author of STAR recommends that `--outAnchorMultimapNmax` should be set at twice the value used in `--outFilterMultimapNmax`, 
        but no less than 50. In our study, we used the same number for both parameters (100), and found negligible differences in identifying 
        multi-mappers. Upon further discussion with the author of STAR, we recommend that setting the same value for `--outAnchorMultimapNmax`
        and `--outFilterMultimapNmax`, though we highly suggest users test multiple values of `--outAnchorMultimapNmax` to identify the 
        optimal value for their experiment.
